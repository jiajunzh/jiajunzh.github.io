    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Input is an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.Find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again). Example 1:Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]Output: 6Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0), sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.Then buy on day 7 (price = 1), sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3. This is a hard-level problem on the LeetCode, which takes me much time to think about. Thus, I’d like to write this post to review this problem. Basically, we can imagine this as two separate purchase-selling process, i.e. [first buy …. first sell] [second buy …. second sell]. It is worth noting that second buy happens only after the first sell. In this way, we can turn this two processes into one-time purchase-selling process which the price on i-th day takes the maximum profits before day i into account.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;$newPrices[i] = prices[i] - maximum\ Profit\ of\ first\ buy$Using dynamic programming algorithm, the implementation is shown as below. 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425class Solution &#123; public int maxProfit(int[] prices) &#123; if (prices == null || prices.length &lt;= 1) &#123; return 0; &#125; int maxProfit = 0; int minCost = prices[0]; int[] dp = new int[prices.length]; dp[0] = prices[0]; // compute the newPrice and store the record in dp[] for (int i = 1; i &lt; prices.length; i++) &#123; minCost = Math.min(minCost, prices[i]); maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, prices[i] - minCost); dp[i] = prices[i] - maxProfit; &#125; maxProfit = 0; minCost = prices[0]; // find the max profit as you only buy once for (int i = 0; i &lt; prices.length; i++) &#123; minCost = Math.min(minCost, dp[i]); maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, prices[i] - minCost); &#125; return maxProfit; &#125;&#125; The above implementation takes two pass. However, if we look a little deeper, we can find that the two pass can actually be combined as one like below. 123456789101112131415class Solution &#123; public int maxProfit(int[] prices) &#123; int sell1 = 0; // maximum profit after first sell int sell2 = 0; // total maximum profit after second sell int buy1 = Integer.MAX_VALUE; int buy2 = Integer.MAX_VALUE; for (int i = 0; i &lt; prices.length; i++) &#123; buy1 = Math.min(buy1, prices[i]); sell1 = Math.max(sell1, prices[i] - buy1); buy2 = Math.min(buy2, prices[i] - sell1); sell2 = Math.max(sell2, prices[i] - buy2); &#125; return sell2; &#125;&#125; Well, I think the above approach is the most compact way to solve this while I think there are other perspectives to look at this problem. For instance, using DP, you can build two arrays, one to store the maximum profit of one buy-sell before day i and one for after day i. We just find the Max(Sum(two arrays)) to solve this problem.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. Starting From Fibonacci NumberFibonacci Number is a series of number satisfying $F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)$, for examaple, {0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13…}. Intuitively, we may resort to recursive approach to this problem. Thought it is pretty straightforward, the ineffiecient recursive call takes the cost of your computational time. So, why is that ? Let’s think about the structure of the call tree. Each fibonacci number relies on the computing of the other two fibonacci number ahead of it. The image before shows the call tree when you get the input as 6 and it is not hard to realize that the tree will have $2^n$ nodes in total with the depth n. The essence of the inefficiency of this approach lies in that we can compute the same fibonacci number (e.g. fib(3) for 3 times) for multiple times which is totally unnecessary. So here is where the Memoization comes in to resue. Top-Down MemoizationAs we have seen the above case, the issue is that the subproblems of the whole problem overlap in some parts leading to ineffecient and unnecessary recalculation. Then how to fix it ? Well, it is quite simple, we trade space with time by keeping a table to record the work you’ve done and you can just return the answer if the subproblem has already been done once. That is roughly the basic idea of Memoization. In general, top-down Memoization is that you start solving the whole problem by breaking it into pieces. Return the solution recorded if the subproblem has already been solved once or solve the subproblem for once otherwise. Ok, now let’s take a deeper look by comparing the memoization approach and non-memoization approach in the context of the fibonacci problem. First, the time complexity. For the non-memoization approach, the time complexity is $O(2^n)$ while for the memoization approach is $O(n)$ which is much better. Then for the space complexity. Remember, space complexity takes any memory you use into account including the call stack. Thus, the space complexity of non-memoization approach is $O(n)$ (e.g. fib(6) - fib(5) - fib(4) - fib(3) - fib(2) - fib(1), the fib(6) has not called fib(4) yet) and it is the same for the memoization approach too (memory for record table). Down-Top TabulationDifferent from Memoization, tabulation solves the problem by starting from the most trivial subproblem, upwards to the top. Let’s look at an example to see how this works. Calculate the total number of possible path to the destination in the image Divide the Problem RecursivelyTo analyze this problem, the green guy can simply walk downwards or to the right (you know, it will be stupid to turn back (i.e. to the left and upwards)). Thus, we can divide this problem as separate steps along path as below.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;$Path(start, end) = Path(A, end) + Path(B, end) = …$ Memoization vs. RecursionWe can see from the image above that Path(C, end) will be calculated twice and so are others, which is fairly inefficient. That is because there are overlapping between some subproblems. Thus we can take the Memoization approach to make sure each subproblem solved only once. To do this, we can use a table to record the total number of paths from a specific point to the end. Start by the Most Trivial ProblemDynamic Programming solves problem from down to top. This idea applies here as well. Instead of starting from the start point, we can think of this problem from the end point backwards.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;$Path(P, end) = Path(P’s\ right, end) + Path(P’s\ down, end)$Thus, we can compute the whole table from the right to left and then down to up. SummaryIn a nutshell, dynamic programming is suitable for the situation where you can divide problem into sub-problems which can be broken down to smaller sub-problems and there is overlapping in solving the sub-problems. It is efficient by only computing the overlapping part once. Basically, optimization and combinatorial problems are of the two most typical problem of dynamic programming problems. The optimization problem requires you to find a feasible solution so that the objective function can be optimized while the combinatorial problems want you to compute the number of ways to do something or possibility of some event happening. Do note that similar to divide-and-conquer though it is, dynamic programming is better when there is overlapping between the subproblems while the divide-and-conquer doesn’t.
